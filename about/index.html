				<p>
					Maureen Kelly’s industry roots trace back to her first job in the creative department of New York’s storied McCaffrey & McCall Advertising, working alongside some of the most innovative producers, art directors, and copywriters of the day. In 1985 Maureen was hired as an assistant at No Soap Productions, a prominent New York audio and music production house, where her talent as a casting professional emerged. Under the tutelage of her mentor, No Soap founder Dan Aron, Maureen’s keen ear and natural directorial instincts flourished, and eventually became the company’s Head Casting Director.
				</p>
				<p>
					After 7 years at No Soap, Maureen struck out and sallied forth to form her own casting house — one with a unique bent. Her vision, radical for the time, was to focus exclusively on off-camera work. While other competitive casting houses were pulled in different directions by the demands of O/C TV, film, radio, and print modeling, the aptly-named Just Voices would devote itself to the single-minded pursuit of excellence in voiceover work. Upon its inception in 1992, word spread about its “specialty” approach to casting, and JV quickly grew in status among industry professionals coast to coast. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Today, Just Voices is distinguished not only for the caliber of its work, but also for its unflagging adaptability, keeping pace with over thirty years’ worth of shake-ups and transformational changes to the industry model. We work with Union and Non-Union talent, drawing upon a vast and diverse network of industry relationships that we continue to grow as we seek out fresh voices the world over. Whatever your medium — animation, commercial advertising, gaming, or the next great innovation in audio entertainment — Just Voices can connect you to the just-right voice.
				</p>
				<p>
					So, pump up the volume, let your voice be heard and request a consultation about your voiceover needs. We’re always listening and look forward to hearing from you.
